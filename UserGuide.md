# Introduction #

Log4Ora is based on the popular <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4J'>Log4j</a> Java logging framework.  It supports the same logging levels as Log4j and is designed to be light weight and easy to use.

New and advanced features in Oracle 11g are utilized to make Log4Ora light weight, versatile, and enterprise ready.
